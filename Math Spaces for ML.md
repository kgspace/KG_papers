# Mathematics Spaces for Machine Learning
We aim to summary the Machine Learning Models from the perspective of Math Spaces, like Euclidean Space, Banach Space, Manifold...
Also, we try to explain the advantages and disadvantages in different Maths Spaces.

## Definition of Spaces and the relationship between them
